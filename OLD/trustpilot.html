                                Trustpilot is a review website for online businesses. Throughout my internship, I was part of the product team that was responsible
                                for invitations.

                                Invitations are different methods that allow companies to collect verified reviews, which are necessary to be qualified for
                                Google Seller Rating (the little stars that show up under the website address on Google Search)

                                The part of the invitations I was working on was the manual invitation methods. These are important for newly registered
                                businesses because they provide an easy way to start collecting reviews by inviting past
                                customers.

                                However, about 20% of the users did not finish the invitation wizard and dropped out, thus not sending out review invitation
                                emails. My job was to identify the pain points in the wizard and fix them to improve the
                                conversion rate.

                                Trustpilot has a freemium business model, thus one of their main goals is to convince their customers to move up from the
                                free tier and pay a subscription for additional features. But for this, the Trustpilot first
                                have to prove their worth, by making companies see how positive reviews could help their
                                business.

                                What made the problem challenging was the scope of the work. I only had my internship to work on this problem, and the invitation
                                wizard/flow is quite big. This meant, that I had to adjust my process because I could not
                                use long duration experiments, like A/B tests.

                                In this project, I was not able to start by conducting a research due to time constraints and the limitations of access to use the analytics tools of the company.
                                Instead, I've been provided with observations and insights from previous user interviews about the areas that could be improved. Thanks to that, I was able to 
                                better understand the user behavior, which led me to began exploring possible solutions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                I've made rough paper sketches of possible solutions, which I then used for creating an interactive prototype. At Trustpilot,
                                the usability test and user interviews are conducted using (high fidelity) prototypes
                                made in Sketch. Therefore, I've learned to use Sketch with Invision and created a pseudo-high
                                fidelity clickable prototype. I'm calling it pseudo-high fidelity, because although it resembled
                                a high-fidelity prototype with its interactivity and realistic look (as I've modified previous
                                designs from Trustpilot's design library), I did not strive to make the design pixel-perfect.

                                Working on iteration was what I've spent most of my time doing on my internship. I ran a screener
                                survey with Qualaroo, to find participants for remote usability tests, that consisted a Think
                                Aloud test and a quick user interview. These sessions served two main purposes. Firstly,
                                validating the prototype. Secondly, using it for product discovery, which is validating the
                                problem I was trying to solve, as to compensate for the gaps in the research and analysis
                                in the beginning. In an iteration, I've refined the prototype based on the previous usability test and repeated the test this new version. I also
                                involved internal experts, such as UX designers, a Copywriter, and a Customer Success Manager
                                into the project to complement the feedback of the users.

                                One of the challenges I've encountered in this project was, that I had to create a design, that could work both in the current
                                setting and in future ones as well. In one case, as I was talking to the Product
                                Manager it turned out, that because of some upcoming changes in a feature that would take place in the next quarters,
                                some design variants had to be discarded, since they wouldn't be viable in the future.

                                Despite the fact, that due to time constraints my new design had not been tested with enough users to be able to measure
                                how it actually affects the conversion rate, the feedbacks were really positive. Multiple users said that it is more
                                straightforward and easier to understand than the current version of the invitation wizard, and some even asked when
                                they can expect to see it in the product. Furthermore, the Product Manager was really fond of the
                                data mapping step I've designed and he is considering to implement it into production.

                                At last, I'd like to mention one thing I have learned on my internship. On my first day, my mentor at Trustpilot gave me a book
                                by Jeff Patton titled User Story Mapping to read it because it's philosophy was fully embraced
                                by the company. At the beginning of the book, the author says the following: “There’s always
                                more to build than we have time or resources to build — always."<sup>1</sup> "...if you get the game
                                right, you will realize that your job is not to build more - it’s to build less. At the end
                                of the day, your job is to minimize output and maximize outcome and impact”<sup>1</sup> I've seen it
                                manifest in real life, as I was working on this project because my background in web development
                                allowed me to identify the design changes would require a lot of resources to build but would
                                result in a barely noticeable impact. Some might say, that this is not the domain of UX,
                                and therefore I should only focus on the users, and let the Product Managers worry about
                                the building cost. However, this insight allowed me to be more productive with my time by
                                prioritizing what problems I should focus on.
                            </p>
